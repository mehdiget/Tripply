publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

    - images/slider/shop2.jpg
    - images/slider/shop3.jpg     
    - images/slider/phone.png
    - images/slider/iphone-12.png
    - images/slider/Casablanca.jpg
    - images/slider/rabat.jpeg
    - images/slider/agadir.jpeg
    - images/slider/marrakech.jpg
    - images/slider/tanger.jpg
    - images/slider/morocco.jpeg
    - images/slider/fes.jpg
    - images/slider/safi.jpg
    - images/slider/google.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Black.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Light.ttf
